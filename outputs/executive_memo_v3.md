# MEMO: Post-Acquisition Vendor Rationalization

**To:** CEO, CFO
**From:** VP Operations
**Date:** December 2024

---

## Bottom Line

We have identified **$490K–$720K in annual savings** from a review of 386 vendors ($7.9M total spend). Three opportunities are ready for execution within 90 days of close, with no risk to customer operations.

---

## The Three Opportunities

**1. Salesforce License Optimization**
Salesforce is 39% of vendor spend ($3.1M). A license audit will likely recover 10–15% through inactive user cleanup and right-sizing entitlements.
- **Savings:** $310K–$470K/year
- **Action:** License audit by Day 60

**2. Workspace Consolidation**
Seven office providers across geographies ($952K). Integration planning should reduce footprint and consolidate to fewer providers.
- **Savings:** $140K–$190K/year
- **Action:** Portfolio review by Day 90

**3. Travel Contract Consolidation**
Navan billed through two entities ($416K combined). Single master agreement enables volume pricing.
- **Savings:** $40K–$60K/year
- **Action:** Contract consolidation by Day 30

## Execution Timeline

| Day 30 | Day 60 | Day 90 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Navan consolidation | Salesforce audit complete | Workspace decisions |

---

## Caveats

- Estimates based on spend data and vendor names only
- Actual savings require contract and utilization validation post-close
- All figures use conservative benchmarks

---

**Recommendation:** Approve all three workstreams at close.
