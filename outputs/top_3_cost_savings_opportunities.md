**Post-Acquisition Vendor Spend Analysis**
**Prepared for:** CEO / CFO Review
**Date:** December 2024
**Source:** vendor_classification_v1_QC.xlsx (386 vendors, $7.89M trailing 12-month spend)

## Opportunity 1: Salesforce License Optimization

**Explanation:**
Salesforce represents $3.12M in annual spend (39.5% of total vendor costs). Enterprise SaaS contracts of this magnitude typically carry 15–25% unused license capacity due to seat over-provisioning, inactive users, and feature entitlements exceeding actual usage. A structured license audit post-close is likely to identify material optimization potential without operational impact.

**Estimated Annual Savings:**
$310,000 – $470,000 (10–15% of $3.12M Salesforce spend)

**Recommended Action:**
Commission a Salesforce license utilization audit within 60 days of close. Engage Salesforce account team or third-party optimization specialist to baseline active users, feature adoption, and contractual entitlements.

## Opportunity 2: Flexible Workspace Portfolio Rationalization

**Explanation:**
The company maintains relationships with seven flexible workspace providers across multiple geographies, totaling $952K in annual spend (12.1% of total). Post-acquisition headcount adjustments and office consolidation typically create opportunities to reduce real estate footprint. The fragmented provider base also limits volume pricing leverage.

**Vendors in scope:**
- Tog UK Properties Limited ($264K)
- Zagrebtower D.O.O. ($184K)
- Innovent Spaces Private Limited ($147K)
- Weking D.O.O. ($144K)
- Gpt Space & Co ($134K)
- WeWork Singapore Pte. Ltd. ($64K)
- Work Easy Space Solutions Private Limited ($15K)

**Estimated Annual Savings:**
$140,000 – $190,000 (15–20% of $952K workspace spend)

**Recommended Action:**
Commission a real estate portfolio review within 90 days of close. Map current seat utilization against post-integration headcount plan. Identify lease expiration dates and consolidation opportunities across locations.

## Opportunity 3: Travel & Expense Platform Consolidation

**Explanation:**
Corporate travel spend is managed through Navan (formerly TripActions) via two separate billing entities, totaling $416K annually. This fragmented structure likely reflects legacy regional contracts and prevents consolidated volume pricing. Merging to a single master agreement would simplify administration and strengthen negotiating position.

**Vendors in scope:**
- Navan (Tripactions Inc): $358K
- Navan, Inc: $58K

**Estimated Annual Savings:**
$40,000 – $60,000 (10–15% of $416K Navan spend)

**Recommended Action:**
Consolidate Navan contracts to a single global master agreement within 30 days of close. Negotiate volume-based pricing tier reflecting combined travel spend.

## Assumptions Requiring Post-Close Validation

1. **Salesforce:** Actual license utilization data not available; 10–15% optimization assumption based on industry benchmarks for enterprise SaaS contracts. Savings dependent on contract renewal timing and termination flexibility.

2. **Workspace:** Lease terms, expiration dates, and exit clause structures unknown. Savings estimate assumes at least one location consolidation and renegotiation of remaining contracts within 12 months.

3. **Travel:** Assumes both Navan entities can be consolidated under existing contract terms. Actual volume discount tiers require Navan account review.

## Quality Assurance Notes

- Savings estimates use conservative end of industry benchmarks
- No opportunity requires disruption to customer-facing or revenue-generating systems
- Combined opportunities address 57% of total vendor spend
- Remaining spend consists primarily of: insurance ($357K), professional services ($898K), engineering tools ($528K), and long-tail vendors
