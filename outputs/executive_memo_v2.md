# Vendor Spend Analysis: Executive Summary

**To:** Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
**From:** VP Operations
**Date:** December 2024
**Subject:** Post-Acquisition Vendor Rationalization — Actionable Opportunities

---

## Overview

A comprehensive review of 386 vendors ($7.9M annual spend) has identified three near-term cost optimization opportunities. These represent low-risk, executable actions with no impact to customer-facing operations.

**Total Estimated Annual Savings: $490,000 – $720,000**

## Priority Opportunities

| Opportunity | Annual Spend | Est. Savings | Timeline |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Salesforce License Optimization | $3.1M | $310K – $470K | 60 days |
| Workspace Portfolio Rationalization | $952K | $140K – $190K | 90 days |
| Travel Platform Consolidation | $416K | $40K – $60K | 30 days |

### 1. Salesforce License Optimization ($310K – $470K)

Salesforce accounts for 39% of total vendor spend. Enterprise contracts at this scale typically carry 10–15% unused license capacity. A post-close utilization audit will identify inactive users and excess entitlements without operational disruption.

**First Action:** Initiate license utilization audit within 60 days.

### 2. Workspace Portfolio Rationalization ($140K – $190K)

Office space is distributed across seven flexible workspace providers in multiple geographies. Post-integration headcount planning and lease review should inform consolidation to fewer providers with improved volume terms.

**First Action:** Commission real estate portfolio review within 90 days.

### 3. Travel Platform Consolidation ($40K – $60K)

Corporate travel is billed through two separate Navan entities ($358K + $58K). Consolidating to a single master agreement enables volume pricing and administrative efficiency.

**First Action:** Consolidate Navan contracts within 30 days.

## Important Caveats

- Savings estimates are based on vendor names and spend data only
- Actual results depend on contract terms, utilization data, and lease structures
- All estimates use conservative industry benchmarks (low end of range)
- Validation required post-close before committing to specific targets

---

## Recommendation

Approve initiation of the three workstreams above upon close. Combined, these opportunities address 57% of total vendor spend and can be substantially executed within the first 90 days.
