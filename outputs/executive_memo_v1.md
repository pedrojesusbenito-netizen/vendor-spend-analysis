# Executive Memo: Vendor Spend Optimization Opportunities

**To:** CEO, CFO

**From:** VP Operations

**Date:** December 2024

**Re:** Post-Acquisition Vendor Rationalization — Preliminary Findings

---

## Summary

We reviewed 386 vendors representing $7.9M in trailing 12-month spend. Three near-term, low-risk opportunities have been identified with combined estimated annual savings of **$490K–$720K** (6–9% of total vendor spend). All three can be executed within 90 days of close with low operational risk.

---

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Salesforce License Optimization
- **Spend:** $3.1M (39% of total)
- **Estimated Savings:** $310K–$470K annually
- **Action:** Conduct license utilization audit within 60 days

Salesforce is the largest single vendor. Industry benchmarks indicate enterprise contracts of this size typically carry 10–15% excess capacity. A utilization review will identify inactive seats and underused entitlements.

### 2. Workspace Portfolio Consolidation
- **Spend:** $952K across 7 providers
- **Estimated Savings:** $140K–$190K annually
- **Action:** Commission real estate portfolio review within 90 days

Office space is fragmented across multiple flexible workspace vendors globally. Post-acquisition headcount planning should inform footprint reduction and provider consolidation.

### 3. Travel Platform Consolidation
- **Spend:** $416K (Navan, 2 entities)
- **Estimated Savings:** $40K–$60K annually
- **Action:** Consolidate to a single master agreement within 30 days

Corporate travel is managed through duplicate Navan billing entities. Merging contracts will simplify administration and enable volume pricing.

## Key Considerations

- **No customer impact:** All actions affect internal tooling and facilities only
- **Conservative estimates:** Savings based on the lower end of industry benchmarks
- **Validation required:** Actual savings depend on contract terms, utilization data, and lease structures not available pre-close
