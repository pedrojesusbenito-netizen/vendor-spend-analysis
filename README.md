# Vendor Spend Strategy Analysis

This repository contains an AI-assisted vendor spend analysis conducted as part of a post-acquisition operational diligence exercise for an enterprise software company.

The objective of the analysis was to:
- Classify vendors by department
- Identify consolidation, optimization, and termination opportunities
- Surface the highest-impact cost-saving initiatives
- Produce an executive-level summary suitable for CEO/CFO review

Claude Code was used as an analytical assistant to operate directly on the files in this repository. All inputs, prompts, outputs, and methodology are included for transparency and reviewer inspection.
