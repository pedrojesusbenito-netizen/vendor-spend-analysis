# Prompt 04 — Executive Readiness & Rubric Compliance Review

## Context

You are reviewing a completed, AI-assisted vendor spend analysis conducted as part of a post-acquisition operational diligence exercise for an enterprise software company.

The submission package includes:

* Classified vendor dataset:
  `outputs/vendor_classification_v1.xlsx`
  (386 vendors, trailing 12-month spend, department, description, recommendation)

* Quality Control review:
  `outputs/vendor_classification_v1_QC.xls`
  (duplicate detection, encoding issues, validation of spend-tier logic)

* Strategic synthesis:
  `outputs/top_3_cost_savings_opportunities.md`

* Executive memo:
  `outputs/executive_memo_v3.md`
The stated objective of the assessment is to demonstrate executive-level judgment, analytical rigor, and clear communication suitable for CEO and CFO consumption.

## Review Dimensions (Do Not Skip Any)

### 1. Analytical Integrity

* Are vendor classifications reasonable given name-only inputs?
* Is department assignment defensible and consistent?
* Are descriptions appropriately hedged where uncertainty exists?
* Are recommendations conservative and realistic?
* Are QC findings properly acknowledged and addressed?

### 2. Strategic Judgment

* Do the Top 3 opportunities target **material spend**, not noise?
* Are savings assumptions conservative and defensible?
* Are opportunities non-overlapping and prioritizable?

### 3. Methodology & Tool Usage

* Is the analytical approach clearly explained?

  * Clear, concise, and outcome-focused
  * Written in CFO/CEO language (not analyst or operator tone)
* Does it emphasize what matters most and omit unnecessary detail?
* Would a CEO be able to act on it after a single read?
