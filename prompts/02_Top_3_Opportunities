# **Prompt 02 — Identify Top 3 Strategic Cost-Savings Opportunities**

**Context**
You have completed a full vendor spend classification based strictly on vendor name and trailing 12-month spend data. Each vendor now has:

* Assigned department
* One-line functional description
* Strategic recommendation (Optimize / Consolidate / Terminate)

You are acting as **VP of Operations** for a recently acquired enterprise software company.

Your objective is to identify the **three highest-impact, executive-level cost-savings opportunities** suitable for immediate post-acquisition action.

---

## **Instructions**

1. **Analyze the full classified vendor dataset**

   * Weight findings by **total annual spend**, not vendor count
   * Focus on **systemic opportunities**, not one-off micro cuts
   * Ignore immaterial vendors unless they indicate structural duplication

2. **Select exactly THREE opportunities**
   Each opportunity must represent:

   * Material financial impact
   * High confidence based on available data
   * Low to moderate execution risk
   * No disruption to core customer or revenue systems

3. **Each opportunity must include:**

   * **Title** (executive-ready, outcome-focused)
   * **Brief explanation** (2–3 sentences max)
   * **Estimated annual savings (USD)**

     * Use conservative, defensible assumptions
     * Express savings as % of identifiable spend where relevant
   * **Recommended first action** (concrete, time-bound)

4. **Assumptions & Constraints**

   * Do NOT assume access to contracts, usage logs, or headcount data
   * Do NOT invent vendor functionality
   * Use hedged language where uncertainty exists (“likely,” “appears,” “indicative”)
   * Avoid speculative transformations or platform replacements

5. **Tone & Audience**

   * Audience: **CEO and CFO**
   * Style: crisp, analytical, confident, non-technical
   * Avoid operational minutiae or implementation detail

## **Output Format**

Return the results in a clean, executive-ready structure:

```
Opportunity 1: [Title]
Explanation:
Estimated Annual Savings:
Recommended Action:

Opportunity 2: [Title]
Explanation:
Estimated Annual Savings:
Recommended Action:

Opportunity 3: [Title]
Explanation:
Estimated Annual Savings:
Recommended Action:
```

## **Quality Bar (Do Not Skip)**

Before finalizing:

* Sanity-check savings estimates for realism
* Confirm no overlap between opportunities
* Ensure the three opportunities together represent the **majority of feasible near-term savings**
* Flag any assumptions that would require validation post-close

---

## **Important Reminder**

This output will be used directly in:

* The **Top 3 Opportunities** tab of the assessment
* The **Executive Memo**

It must withstand scrutiny from an experienced CFO.
